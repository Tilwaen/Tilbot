# Tilbot

Til's bot for the Flairwars Discord.

*Built upon https://github.com/An-Idiots-Guide/guidebot.git*

Feel free to use this code for your own bot. Note that there is no public `config.js` in this repository, meaning that you won't be able to just clone it and run it. I can provide a mock one.

Unless you have a Flair mod scope access on Reddit, all the commands which verify flair colour (`count`, `whois`, `redditinfo`, etc.) will not work for you.

Same goes for editing the shard balance if you don't have permissions for that on your server.
